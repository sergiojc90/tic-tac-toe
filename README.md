# Project: TIC TAC TOE using JavaScript

Hi! Great to see you!

In this project I'm going to make a Tic Tac Toe game to play in the browser, one of the challanges is to have as little global code as possible with the help of modules and factory functions.

I've done this project as a part of JavaScript Fullstack curriculum of The Oding Project.

You are welcome to see the live version of the project [here](https://sergiojc90.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).
